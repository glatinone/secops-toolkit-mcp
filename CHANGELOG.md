# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- README: Quickstart, worked Examples for every tool with real input/output,
  a Docker usage section, and a Troubleshooting section.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-07-11

### Added

- GitHub Actions CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`): runs the test suite with `uv`
  on Python 3.11, 3.12, and 3.13, and verifies the package builds with `uv build`.
  The repo had no CI at all before this — every prior release depended on tests
  having been run locally before pushing.
- CI and License badges in the README.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-30

### Added

- Initial release: `extract_iocs`, `defang_ioc`, `refang_ioc`, `hash_text`,
  `password_entropy`, `cidr_info`, `ip_in_cidr` tools over FastMCP. Never tagged
  on GitHub — `0.2.0` is this project's first tagged release.
